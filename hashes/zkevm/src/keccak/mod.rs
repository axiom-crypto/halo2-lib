//! The zkEVM keccak circuit implementation, with some modifications.
//! Credit goes to https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits/tree/main/zkevm-circuits/src/keccak_circuit
//!
//! This is a lookup table based implementation, where bytes are packed into big field elements as efficiently as possible.
//! The circuits can be configured to use different numbers of columns, by specifying the number of rows per internal
//! round of the keccak_f permutation.

/// Module for component circuits.

/// Module for Keccak circuits in vanilla halo2.
