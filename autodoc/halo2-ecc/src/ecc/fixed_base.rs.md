The file `fixed_base.rs` is a module for fixed-base scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve. It uses the Halo 2 proving library and depends on the `bigint`, `fields`, `group`, `itertools`, and `rayon` crates. The module includes a struct `FixedEcPoint` representing a fixed point on an elliptic curve, along with several methods for constructing and assigning it to a context, as well as a function `scalar_multiply` that computes `[scalar] * P` on the curve `y^2 = x^3 + b` where `P` is a fixed point represented by `C` and `scalar` is represented as a reference array of `AssignedValue`s. The function also assumes that `scalar_i < 2^{max_bits}` for all `i` and that `max_bits <= modulus::<F>.bits()`. Another function in the module is `msm`, which computes the multi-scalar multiplication of `points` with `scalars` using the fixed-base method. It computes all cached points in Jacobian coordinates and then batch normalizes them for use in circuits. Finally, it calls `scalar_multiply` for each chunk of cached points and bits of scalars and returns the sum of the resulting `EcPoint`s.
This file contains two functions, msm and msm_par, which implement multi-scalar multiplication of a fixed set of points on an elliptic curve. msm uses a sequential algorithm to perform the multiplication, while msm_par uses a parallel algorithm to perform the multiplication. Both functions take a set of points, a set of scalars, and various other parameters as input, and return the resulting point. The algorithm for both functions involves computing all cached points in Jacobian coordinates, batch normalizing them to affine coordinates, splitting the scalars into bit windows, and then using the cached points and the bits to compute the resulting point. The msm_par function uses a parallel implementation to improve efficiency. Write me a reference documentation for this file.
