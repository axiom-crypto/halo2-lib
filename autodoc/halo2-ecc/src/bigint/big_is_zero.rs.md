This code is part of a Halo 2 proving library and contains functions for working with integers in the context of zero-knowledge proofs. The functions provided here operate on custom integer types, specifically `OverflowInteger<F>` and `CRTInteger<F>`, where `F` is a generic scalar field.

1. `positive` function:
   - This function checks if an `OverflowInteger<F>` is positive.
   - The function takes three arguments: `gate`, `ctx`, and `a`.
   - `gate` is an object implementing the `GateInstructions<F>` trait.
   - `ctx` is a mutable reference to a `Context<F>` object.
   - `a` is a reference to an `OverflowInteger<F>` object.
   - The function returns an `AssignedValue<F>` which represents whether the integer is positive or not.

2. `assign` function:
   - This function checks if an `OverflowInteger<F>` is equal to 0.
   - The function takes three arguments: `gate`, `ctx`, and `a`.
   - `gate` is an object implementing the `GateInstructions<F>` trait.
   - `ctx` is a mutable reference to a `Context<F>` object.
   - `a` is a reference to an `OverflowInteger<F>` object.
   - The function returns an `AssignedValue<F>` which represents whether the integer is equal to 0 or not.

3. `crt` function:
   - This function checks if a `CRTInteger<F>` is equal to 0.
   - The function takes three arguments: `gate`, `ctx`, and `a`.
   - `gate` is an object implementing the `GateInstructions<F>` trait.
   - `ctx` is a mutable reference to a `Context<F>` object.
   - `a` is a reference to a `CRTInteger<F>` object.
   - The function returns an `AssignedValue<F>` which represents whether the integer is equal to 0 or not.
