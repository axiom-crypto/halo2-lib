This code snippet contains two functions, `assign` and `crt`, that are related to the Halo 2 proving library. The library is used for building zero-knowledge proofs, which allow proving the correctness of a statement without revealing any information about the statement itself. The Halo 2 library is based on arithmetic circuits over scalar fields.

1. `assign` function:
The `assign` function takes in two `OverflowInteger<F>` instances, `a` and `b`, and an `AssignedValue<F>` instance, `sel`. It creates a new `OverflowInteger<F>` instance where each limb is selected from either `a` or `b` based on the value of `sel`. If `sel` is 0, the corresponding limb from `b` is selected; otherwise, the limb from `a` is selected. It does so using the `select` function provided by the `gate` parameter, which is an instance implementing the `GateInstructions<F>` trait.

2. `crt` function:
The `crt` function takes in two `CRTInteger<F>` instances, `a` and `b`, and an `AssignedValue<F>` instance, `sel`. It creates a new `CRTInteger<F>` instance by selecting limbs from the `truncation` field of both `a` and `b` based on the value of `sel`, similar to the `assign` function. Additionally, it selects the native representation of the selected `CRTInteger<F>` based on the value of `sel`. Finally, it constructs and returns a new `CRTInteger<F>` instance with the selected limbs and native representation.

Both of these functions use the provided gate and context to perform the selection, and they check that the input limbs are of the same length using `debug_assert_eq!`.
