This code defines three functions in Rust that are part of a larger library based on the Halo 2 proving system. The functions work with `OverflowInteger` and `CRTInteger` types, which are custom integer types in this library. These functions are used to compare two integers of these custom types for equality. The code relies on the `halo2_base` crate for handling arithmetic circuits in the context of a zero-knowledge proof.

1. `assign` function:
This function takes two `OverflowInteger<F>` arguments, `a` and `b`, and checks if they are equal. The function iterates through the limbs of both integers and checks for equality between corresponding limbs. If all limbs are equal, the final output is true, otherwise false. The output is an `AssignedValue<F>` which represents a boolean value within the arithmetic circuit.

2. `wrapper` function:
This function is a simple wrapper around the `assign` function. It takes two `CRTInteger<F>` arguments, `a` and `b`, and compares their truncations (which are of type `OverflowInteger<F>`) for equality using the `assign` function. The output is an `AssignedValue<F>` which represents a boolean value within the arithmetic circuit.

3. `crt` function:
This function takes two `CRTInteger<F>` arguments, `a` and `b`, and checks if they are equal. First, it asserts that the underlying values of both `CRTInteger`s are the same. Then, it compares the truncations of both integers for equality using the `assign` function, and it also compares the native representations of both integers for equality. The output is an `AssignedValue<F>` which represents a boolean value within the arithmetic circuit, and it is true if and only if both the truncations and native representations are equal.
