This Rust code defines two functions, `truncate` and `crt`, which are part of the `mul_no_carry.rs` file in a Halo 2 proving library. Both functions perform multiplications without considering carry, but they differ in how they represent the input integers and the intermediate results.

1. `truncate` function:
This function takes two `OverflowInteger` objects, `a` and `b`, and a number `num_limbs_log2_ceil`. It performs a multiplication of the two input integers without considering carry and returns the result as an `OverflowInteger`.

- The function first checks if the number of limbs and maximum limb bits of `a` and `b` are the same and asserts that the sum of `num_limbs_log2_ceil`, `a.max_limb_bits`, and `b.max_limb_bits` is less than or equal to `F::NUM_BITS - 2`.
- Then, it iterates through the limbs of the input integers and computes the inner product of the limbs, using the `gate.inner_product` function.
- Finally, the function constructs a new `OverflowInteger` object using the computed limbs and the sum of `num_limbs_log2_ceil`, `a.max_limb_bits`, and `b.max_limb_bits`.

2. `crt` function:
This function takes two `CRTInteger` objects, `a` and `b`, and a number `num_limbs_log2_ceil`. It performs a multiplication of the two input integers using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) representation and returns the result as a `CRTInteger`.

- The function first calls the `truncate` function, passing the truncation parts of `a` and `b` and the `num_limbs_log2_ceil` value, and stores the result in `out_trunc`.
- Then, it multiplies the native parts of `a` and `b` using the `gate.mul` function and stores the result in `out_native`.
- It also computes the product of the values of `a` and `b` and stores it in `out_val`.
- Finally, the function constructs a new `CRTInteger` object using `out_trunc`, `out_native`, and `out_val`.
